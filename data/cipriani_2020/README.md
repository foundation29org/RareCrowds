# Cipriani et al. 2020

This directory contains the data found in the supplemental materials of [Cipriani et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230372/bin/genes-11-00460-s001.pdf).

## Phenotype data
The phenotype data is found in any of the `tsv` files. This format is not ideal, it was simply used to be consistent with the data stored from Rao et al. Table S1 was copied and table S2 was used to replace clinical annotations with HPO terms.
